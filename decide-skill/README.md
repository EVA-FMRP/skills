Randomly choose between two specified options

## About 
This skill makes a random choice between two specified options. You can ask who is going to win the game, what should you wear, what you should eat, or simply "decide" between two options.

## Examples 
* "Who is going to win tonight's game, Villanova or Duke?"
* "What should I eat for lunch, burger or sushi?"
* "What should I wear, t-shirt or polo?"
* "Decide heads or tails"
