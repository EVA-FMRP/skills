## Installer
Skill installer system

## Description
Add and remove skills using the Mycroft Skill Manager (MSM).  Install a
skill verbally by saying "install <skill identifier>", where <skill
identifier> is the full name or at least adequate subset of the name to
uniquely identify the skill.  See the list of skill names at the 
[mycroft-skills repo](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-skills#community-contributed-skill-list).

You can also install skills that are not registered by entering the repo's
URL in the [Installer web user interface](https://home.mycroft.ai/#/skill).

## Examples
* "Install coin flip"
* "Uninstall skill coin flip"
* "Remove skill coin flip"
* "Download custom skill"
