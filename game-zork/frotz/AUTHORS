Thanks also to those who posted to rec.arts.int-fiction and 
intfiction.org feedback on what I was doing with Unix Frotz, people who 
checked the betas for bugs, and sent in patches.  These include, but are 
not limited to:

Torbjorn Anderson, Timo Korvola, Martin Frost, Mihail Milushev, David 
Picton, Archturiat Baumann, Leonard Richardson, Stephen Kitt, Paul E 
Coad, Paul Janzen, Brad Town, Jason C Penney, Denis Hirschfeldt, Jacob 
Nevins, Matteo De Luigi, Steven Frank, Thomas Troeger, David Kinder, and 
others that I've forgotten.

Michael Edmonson (author of Rezrov) and Evin Robertson (author of Nitfol)
deserve recognition for the ideas that I've borrowed from their programs.

Thanks goes to Erik de Castro Lopo, author of libsndfile and 
libsamplerate for putting up with my numerous questions about audio 
programming and gently nudging me towards how to do things the right 
way.
